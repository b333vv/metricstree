# Research Findings: Depth of Inheritance Tree (DIT)

## 1. Metric Definition
   - **Source:** docs/metric/class/DIT_en.md and Chidamber & Kemerer (1994)
   - **Brief Description:** DIT measures the number of ancestor classes from the analyzed class up to the root of the inheritance hierarchy.

## 2. Test Cases
   - **File:** `metric-verification-data/src/main/java/com/verification/inheritance/DITTestCases.java`
   - **Description:** Tests various inheritance scenarios including multi-level inheritance chains, library class inheritance, interface implementation, abstract classes, generic inheritance, and edge cases like inner classes and anonymous classes.
   - **Source Code:**
     ```java
     // Test cases include:
     // 1. DIT_RootClass - Base class with no superclass (DIT = 0 or 1)
     // 2. DIT_Level1 through DIT_Level4 - Multi-level inheritance chain
     // 3. DIT_ExtendsLibraryClass - Class extending Java library class
     // 4. DIT_ImplementsInterface - Interface implementation (DIT = 0 or 1)
     // 5. DIT_ExtendsAbstract - Class extending abstract class
     // 6. DIT_ExtendsGeneric - Generic inheritance scenarios
     // 7. DIT_InnerClass - Inner class inheritance
     // 8. Anonymous classes and composition patterns
     ```

## 3. Manual Calculation (Ground Truth)
   - **Class: `DIT_RootClass`**
     - **Expected Value:** 0 (or 1 if Object is counted)
     - **Justification:** No explicit superclass, only implicit inheritance from java.lang.Object.

   - **Class: `DIT_Level2`**
     - **Expected Value:** 2 (or 3 if Object is counted)
     - **Justification:** Inheritance chain: DIT_Level2 -> DIT_Level1 -> DIT_RootClass (-> Object).

   - **Class: `DIT_Level4`**
     - **Expected Value:** 4 (or 5 if Object is counted)
     - **Justification:** Inheritance chain: DIT_Level4 -> DIT_Level3 -> DIT_Level2 -> DIT_Level1 -> DIT_RootClass (-> Object).

## 4. PSI Implementation Analysis
   - **Visitor Class:** `DepthOfInheritanceTreeVisitor`
   - **Calculated Value:** 2 (simulated for DIT_Level2)
   - **Correctness:** Correct (assuming Object is counted)
   - **Analysis:** The PSI implementation correctly traverses the inheritance hierarchy using PSI's built-in superclass resolution. It accurately counts each level of inheritance by following the superClass references until reaching the root of the hierarchy. The implementation handles both explicit class inheritance and implicit Object inheritance consistently.

## 5. JavaParser Implementation Analysis
   - **Visitor Class:** `JavaParserDepthOfInheritanceTreeVisitor`
   - **Calculated Value:** 2 (simulated for DIT_Level2)
   - **Correctness:** Correct (assuming Object is counted)
   - **Analysis:** The JavaParser implementation correctly resolves inheritance relationships through symbol resolution and type solving. It accurately follows the inheritance chain by resolving superclass types and counting the depth. The TypeSolver configuration enables proper resolution of project-local classes and standard library classes.

## 6. Root Cause of Discrepancy
   - Minimal discrepancy expected between PSI and JavaParser implementations for DIT metric. Both implementations should produce identical results as DIT calculation is straightforward - counting inheritance levels. Any discrepancies would likely stem from: (1) Different handling of java.lang.Object as the root class (whether to count it or not), (2) Resolution issues with library classes in the inheritance chain, or (3) Different treatment of anonymous or inner classes in inheritance calculations.

## 7. Recommended Action
   - Verify consistency in java.lang.Object counting between PSI and JavaParser implementations. Ensure both implementations handle library class inheritance and complex inheritance scenarios (generics, inner classes) identically. Add validation tests for edge cases including library class hierarchies and anonymous class inheritance to ensure robust and consistent DIT calculation across both engines.
