# MetricsTree IntelliJ IDEA plugin [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/b333vv/metricstree.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/b333vv)

MetricsTree is an IDE extension that helps to evaluate quantitative properties of java code.
It supports the most common sets of metrics at the project, package, class, and method levels.

# Featutes   
 - Represents metrics calculation results in forms of trees and treemaps
 - Builds trees with metrics for class open in the editor or for the entire project
 - Supports controlling calculated metrics values
 - Finds common anti-patterns such as 'god class', 'feature envy', 'brain method' etc and allows to define new ones
 - Displays various metrics properties (distributions, correlations) in charts
 - Shows class metrics values evolution based on 'git log'
