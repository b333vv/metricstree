# Halstead Metrics Calculation Logic

**Halstead metrics** are a set of software metrics that measure various aspects of code complexity based on the number and types of operators and operands in the code. The following metrics are calculated for a class:

- **CHEF (Effort):** Estimated effort required to implement or understand the class.
- **CHER (Estimated Errors):** Estimated number of errors in the class.
- **CHVL (Volume):** Size of the implementation in terms of information content.
- **CHD (Difficulty):** Difficulty of writing or understanding the class.
- **CHVC (Vocabulary):** Number of unique operators and operands.
- **CHL (Length):** Total number of operators and operands.

### Main Calculation Logic in HalsteadClassVisitor

1. **Traverse Class Code:**
   - All operators and operands in the class are identified and counted.

2. **Calculate Distinct and Total Counts:**
   - The number of unique operators and operands (vocabulary) and the total number of each (length) are determined.

3. **Apply Halstead Formulas:**
   - Volume, difficulty, effort, estimated errors, and other metrics are calculated using standard Halstead formulas based on these counts.

### Example
If a class uses 10 unique operators and 20 unique operands, with 50 total operators and 100 total operands, the Halstead metrics are computed using these values.

### Purpose of the Metrics
Halstead metrics provide quantitative measures of software complexity, maintainability, and potential error-proneness.
