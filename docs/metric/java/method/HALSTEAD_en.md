# Halstead Metrics Calculation Logic (HD, HEF, HER, HL, HVC, HVL)

The Halstead metrics are a suite of software metrics that quantify various aspects of source code complexity based on operators and operands in a method.

---

## HL (Halstead Length)
**Definition:** Total number of operators and operands in a method.

### Calculation Logic
1. Traverse the method, counting every operator and operand.
2. HL = (number of operators) + (number of operands).

**Example:** 10 operators + 15 operands = HL = 25.

---

## HVC (Halstead Vocabulary)
**Definition:** Number of distinct operators and operands in a method.

### Calculation Logic
1. Identify all unique operators and operands.
2. HVC = (number of unique operators) + (number of unique operands).

**Example:** 5 unique operators + 8 unique operands = HVC = 13.

---

## HD (Halstead Difficulty)
**Definition:** Quantifies the difficulty of writing or understanding the method.

### Calculation Logic
1. Count unique operators (n1), unique operands (n2), and total operands (N2).
2. HD = (n1 / 2) * (N2 / n2)

**Example:** n1=5, n2=8, N2=20 → HD = (5/2) * (20/8) = 6.25.

---

## HVL (Halstead Volume)
**Definition:** Measures the size of the implementation of a method.

### Calculation Logic
1. Use HL and HVC values.
2. HVL = HL * log2(HVC)

**Example:** HL=25, HVC=13 → HVL = 25 * log2(13) ≈ 92.5.

---

## HER (Halstead Estimated Errors)
**Definition:** Estimates the number of errors in a method based on its volume.

### Calculation Logic
1. Use the Halstead Volume (HVL).
2. HER = HVL / 3000

**Example:** HVL = 90 → HER = 90 / 3000 = 0.03.

---

## HEF (Halstead Effort)
**Definition:** Estimates the mental effort required to implement or understand the method.

### Calculation Logic
1. Use Halstead Difficulty (HD) and Volume (HVL).
2. HEF = HD * HVL

**Example:** HD = 6.25, HVL = 92.5 → HEF = 6.25 * 92.5 = 578.13.

## Purpose of Halstead Metrics
Halstead metrics provide quantitative measures of code complexity, effort, and maintainability, helping developers assess and improve code quality.
