# HER (Halstead Estimated Errors) Metric Calculation Logic

**HER (Halstead Estimated Errors)** estimates the number of errors in a method based on its volume.

### Main Calculation Logic

1. **Calculate Volume (HVL):**
   - Use the Halstead Volume value for the method.
2. **Estimate Errors:**
   - HER = HVL / 3000

### Example
If HVL = 90, HER = 90 / 3000 = 0.03.

### Purpose of the Metric
HER provides a theoretical estimate of the number of errors in the code.
