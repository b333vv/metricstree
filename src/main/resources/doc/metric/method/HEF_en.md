# HEF (Halstead Effort) Metric Calculation Logic

**HEF (Halstead Effort)** estimates the mental effort required to implement or understand the method.

### Main Calculation Logic

1. **Calculate Difficulty (HD) and Volume (HVL):**
   - Use previously calculated Halstead Difficulty and Volume.
2. **Calculate Effort:**
   - HEF = HD * HVL

### Example
If HD = 6.25 and HVL = 92.5, then HEF = 6.25 * 92.5 = 578.13.

### Purpose of the Metric
HEF helps evaluate the effort needed for code comprehension or implementation.
