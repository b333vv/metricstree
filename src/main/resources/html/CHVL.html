<h3>Halstead Metrics</h3>
<p class="main">
    The Halstead complexity metric is used to measure the complexity of a software program without running the program itself.
    This metric is a static testing method where measurable software properties are identified and evaluated. The source code is analyzed and broken down to a sequence of tokens. The tokens are then classified and counted as operators or operands.
    The operators and operands are classified and counted as follows:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Number of distinct operators: n1</li>
    <li>Number of distinct operands: n2</li>
    <li>Total number of operators: N1</li>
    <li>Total number of operands: N2</li>
    <li>Halstead Vocabulary: n = n1 + n2</li>
    <li>Halstead Length: N = N1 + N2</li>
    <li>Halstead Difficulty: D = (n1 / 2) * (N2 / n2)</li>
    <li>Halstead Volume: V = N * log2(n)</li>
    <li>Halstead Effort: E = V * D</li>
    <li>Halstead Errors: Er = ( E ^ (2/3) ) / 3000</li>
</ul>
<p class="main">
    Halstead complexity measures are software metrics introduced by Maurice Howard Halstead in 1977 as part of his treatise on establishing an empirical science of software development.
