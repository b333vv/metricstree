<h3>Maintainability Index</h3>
<p class="main">
    The Maintainability Index first appeared in 1992 when it was proposed by Paul Oman and Jack Hagemeister
    at the International Conference on Software Maintenance with the goal of establishing automated
    software development metrics to guide “software related decision making”.
    The Maintainability Index tries to give a holistic view of the relative maintenance burden for
    different sections of a project by blending together a series of different metrics.

<p class="main">
    Here we use a more modern adaptation of the original formula proposed in 2011 by Microsoft:
</p>
<p class="main">
    <code>Maintainability Index = MAX(0,(171 - 5.2 * ln(Halstead Volume)
    - 0.23 * (Cyclomatic Complexity) - 16.2 * ln(Lines of Code))*100 / 171)</code>
</p>
<p class="values">
    Threshold Values: 0-9 = Good; 10-19 = Acceptable; 20-100 = Bad
