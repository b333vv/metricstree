<h3>Depth of Inheritance Tree (DIT)</h3>
<p class="main">
    Depth of Inheritance Tree (DIT) is the maximum length of a path from a class to a root class in the inheritance
    structure of a system.
    DIT measures how many super-classes can affect a class.

                        Understanding if a class is suitable for reuse
                        depends on the size of its interface. Classes

                        potentially inherit many methods from
                        super-classes. Moreover, the definitions of
                        inherited methods are not local to the class

                        How well a class can be integrated depends on the

                        to the number of methods of the class. Classes

                        Changing a class requires prior understanding,
                        which, in turn, is more complicated for classes
                        with many methods. Classes that are deep down in
                        the classes hierarchy potentially inherit many

                    <dd>
                        Complete testing requires coverage of all
                        execution paths. The number of possible execution
                        paths of a class increases with the number of
                        methods and their control flow complexity.
                        Classes that are deep down in the classes
                        hierarchy potentially inherit many methods from
                        super-classes. Due to late binding, super-class
                        methods need to be tested again in the sub-class
                        context. This makes it it potentially harder to
                        test classes deep down in the classes hierarchy.

                        As for changeability,
                        the size of software has a direct impact. Classes
                        that are deep down in the classes hierarchy
                        potentially inherit many methods from

                        The substitute of a component must imitate its
                        interface. Large interfaces are difficult to
                        check for substitutability and to actually
                        substitute. Interface size increases for classes
                        that are deep down in the classes hierarchy.
