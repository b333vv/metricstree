<h3>Method Cognitive Complexity (CCM)</h3>
<p class="main">
    A Cognitive Complexity score is assessed according to three basic rules [1]:

    <ol>
        <li>Ignore structures that allow multiple statements to be readably shorthanded into one</li>
        <li>Increment (add one) for each break in the linear flow of the code</li>
        <li>Increment when flow-breaking structures are nested</li>
    </ol>

    Additionally, a complexity score is made up of four different types of increments:

    <ol>
        <li>Nesting - assessed for nesting control flow structures inside each other</li>
        <li>Structural - assessed on control flow structures that are subject to a nesting increment, and that increase the nesting count</li>
        <li>Increment when flow-breaking structures are nested</li>
        <li>Hybrid - assessed on control flow structures that are not subject to a nesting increment, but which do increase the nesting count</li>
    </ol>

    While the type of an increment makes no difference in the math - each increment adds one to the final score - making a distinction among the categories of features being counted makes it easier to understand where nesting increments do and do not apply.

<p class="values">
    common value for this metric is less than 8, casual - between 8 and 12, uncommon is greater than 12.
